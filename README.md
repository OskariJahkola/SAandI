# About used calendar

Basically I've found a calendar which you can edit in the embedded window, BUT you have to be logged in.
So IF we are going to just do live demo, we can use it and show that you can edit, delete, add custom events. During the demo
we would be logged in with our account with cookies enabled which is enough. The calendar hosting service is keepandshare.com

The account:
* login: customer1
* password: lut12345

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
