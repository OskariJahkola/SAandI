			<h1>Recycle4Me has you covered!</h1> 
			<br/>
		<p>Recycle4Me is a service that allows you to request a pickup service for your waste that the general garbage service doesn’t collect, i.e. large furniture, old appliances, and other problem waste.</p>
		<p>The service is provided free of charge because the cost of operation is insignificant compared to the ecological value gained by providing a way to reduce unsorted waste.</p>
		<p>If you have waste that needs special handling, request a pickup and we’ll handle it from there! If you can’t be around personally to hand out said waste, leave it at an appointed spot for pickup.</p>
